# Notebooks

Jupyter Python notebooks for ad hoc explorations of QC results. The corresponding SQL and tests are in the [sql](../sql) subdirectory.

## To run the notebooks

This notebook was authored using [Google Colaboratory](http://colab.research.google.com) which is designed to integrate with GitHub. Colab can load public github notebooks directly. For example:

* consider the notebook https://github.com/verilylifesciences/variant-qc/blob/master/notebooks/PrivateVariants.ipynb
* which can be opened in Colab via https://colab.research.google.com/github/verilylifesciences/variant-qc/blob/master/notebooks/PrivateVariants.ipynb
