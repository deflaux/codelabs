# Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks for ad hoc explorations of QC results. The corresponding SQL and tests are in the [sql](../sql) subdirectory.

## To run the notebooks

The `PrivateVariants.ipynb` notebook was authored using [Google Colaboratory](http://colab.research.google.com) which is designed to integrate with GitHub. Colab can load public github notebooks directly. For example to open notebook https://github.com/verilylifesciences/variant-qc/blob/master/notebooks/PrivateVariants.ipynb in Colab, use URL https://colab.research.google.com/github/verilylifesciences/variant-qc/blob/master/notebooks/PrivateVariants.ipynb

The notebook `ExploreSampleQCResults.ipynb` was authored in [AI Platform Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks/) using R 3.6.
